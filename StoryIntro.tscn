Alf: I think I drowned. I think I died. 


Death is a dark thing. He couldn’t see, and he couldn’t feel. There was only nothingness, who wanted to know who he was.

Alf: I am Alf.


But that wasn’t what the voice wanted.


Alf: There are many ways to answer who I am. I'm a boy, so I'm male, human and small, but I guess those are just things about my body?


Alf: I like swimming, video games, reading and the ocean. But I guess those are also just things as well. Am I those things?


The voice only wanted to know if Alf was guilty or innocent.


Alf: Oh, I’m not sure. What specifically am I guilty or innocent of?


The voice wanted to know about the average. Did he deserve eternal punishment or eternal peace?


(It was useless to lie to the voice. The voice would know.)


Alf: I think, on average, I’m neither. I was sometimes guilty and sometimes innocent. I don’t think I deserve any eternity.


Then how did Alf wanted to decide what eternity he deserved?


Alf: A test.
